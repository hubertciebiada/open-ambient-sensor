"""
Generate the KiCad 10 base project for OAS (Open Ambient Sensor).

Produces:
  - oas.kicad_pro       (project; design rules tuned for JLCPCB)
  - oas.kicad_sch       (root schematic, references 4 sub-sheets)
  - power.kicad_sch     (power sub-sheet — input terminal J1 + power flags)
  - mcu.kicad_sch       (MCU sub-sheet)
  - sensors.kicad_sch   (sensors sub-sheet)
  - io.kicad_sch        (empty sub-sheet — chord connector cluster)
  - oas.kicad_pcb       (board outline on Edge.Cuts + 3 mounting holes)
  - libraries/oas.pretty/MountingHole_3.8mm_M3.kicad_mod  (custom footprint)

Geometry is derived from the SZOMK AK-N-94 manufacturer DXF:
  - PCB: Ø120 mm D-shape (arc R=60 + flat chord 82.6 mm at the bottom)
  - 3× M3 mounting holes (Ø3.8 mm) on pitch circle Ø110 mm
  - Origin = centre of the PCB outline circle = centroid of the pitch circle

In KiCad, +Y grows downward on screen, so the flat chord at +Y is visually
the *bottom edge* — matching CLAUDE.md ("flat chord on the bottom edge for
natural convection upward").

# As a starting heuristic, the PCB roughly resembles a clock face with power
# on the upper-left, MCU on the upper-right and sensors filling the bottom
# half — 24 V enters through the central cable hole and power flows roughly
# clockwise. This is a hint to keep rails short, not a hard constraint:
# components may cross any imagined boundary if the layout needs it (the
# SEN66 in particular is large and may span what would otherwise be the
# "sensors" region). No separator lines or sector labels are drawn on the
# PCB — the hierarchical schematic sub-sheets (power / mcu / sensors / io)
# are a functional grouping, not a geographic mapping.

# Cable pass-through hole in the centre of the PCB.
# 24 V (and optional PE) wires enter the case from the rear (electrical box
# behind the unit) and pass through this hole to a terminal block mounted on
# the front side of the PCB. Keeping the entry inside the PCB outline
# physically shields the bare wires — they are inaccessible from outside the
# enclosure, even though 24 V DC is nominally SELV.
# Sized for 3× 1.5 mm² conductors (e.g. YDY 3×1.5, outer Ø ≈ 8-9 mm) with

# SEN66 PCB placement (mechanical reference + zip-tie holes + J3 socket)
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The SEN66 mounts on the enclosure cover, NOT on the PCB (CLAUDE.md: SEN66
# height 21.5 mm > 17 mm front-side limit). The PCB carries:
#   1. A no-pad mechanical-reference footprint (`SEN66_Mechanical_Reference`)
#      drawn on F.Fab / F.SilkS — marks where the SEN66 body "shadow" sits
#      so neighbouring components (VEML7700, LD2410, NT3H2211) stay clear.
#   2. Four NPTH zip-tie holes (Ø 3.0 mm) that pinch the SEN66 against
#      the cover, threaded through both PCB and cover plate.
#   3. The PCB-side JST GH 6-pin socket (J3) that mates with the SEN66's
#      ~50 mm signal cable.
#
# Placement (PCB-local mm, origin = PCB centroid; +Y = down on screen =
# toward the chord):
#
#   SEN66 reference: anchor at (SEN66_ANCHOR_X, SEN66_ANCHOR_Y),
#   rotation SEN66_ROTATION. Long axis runs RADIALLY (6:00 direction)
#   so cable runs are short; connector edge points toward
#   PCB center (cable hole) so the JST GH cable has the shortest run.
#
# Rotation 90° in KiCad's convention maps footprint-local +X (long
# axis, connector edge direction) to PCB -Y (upward, toward 12:00 /
# PCB center) and footprint-local +Y (short axis) to PCB +X (rightward,
# toward 3:00). Anchor (0, 0) in footprint coords is the corner of the
# 55.2 × 25.6 mm body face; placing this anchor at PCB (cx, cy) puts
# the body in PCB X = cx..cx+25.6, Y = cy-55.2..cy.

#
# These are the visible features ON THE BOTTOM FACE of the SEN66 (the face
# that lays against the cover, the one carrying the inlets and outlet):
#   Inlet #1 (obround):  center (10.70, 7.40),  size 15.05 × 7.05 mm
#   Inlet #2 (rect):     center (10.65, 18.85), size 15.14 × 8.14 mm
#   Outlet (circle):     center (42.40, 12.80), Ø 20.74 mm
#   Connector exit:      +X short edge, mid-Y (≈ 55.2, 12.80)
#   Foam-divider rib zone: across the body width at X ≈ 26 mm — the
#     mechanical-design-guide §2.1 sealing rib that separates inlet zone
#     from outlet zone, ensuring ambient air takes the intended path.
#
# This footprint is MECHANICAL-REFERENCE ONLY:
#   - The SEN66 mounts on the inside of the enclosure cover, NOT on the PCB
#     (CLAUDE.md: SEN66 height 21.5 mm > 17 mm front-side limit).
#   - The PCB-side footprint is purely a placement marker — it tells the
#     PCB designer where the SEN66 "lives" relative to the PCB centroid
#     so the JST GH cable run length stays consistent across builds, and
#     so the layout can place VEML7700 / LD2410 / NT3H2211 clear of
#     the SEN66 shadow.
#   - No pads, no drilled holes (the 4× zip-tie holes are a separate
#     footprint: `ZipTieHole_3mm_NPTH`).

    KiCad 10 stores footprint references in the PCB file as a full
    repetition of the footprint geometry (not just a library reference).
    This helper builds the same 'fp_circle on F.CrtYd + fp_circle on
    F.Fab + fp_circle on F.SilkS + np_thru_hole pad' pattern that
    `gen_ziptie_hole_footprint()` writes to the library file, but
    placed at the given PCB-global (x, y).

    The library file holds the canonical definition; the placement
    here is the embedded copy KiCad expects inside the .kicad_pcb.
    Keeping the two in lock-step is essential so opening pcbnew without
    the project-local footprint library still renders the placement.

    If `silk_label` is non-None, an additional `(fp_text user ...)` on
    F.SilkS with that text is emitted at footprint-local
    (0, silk_label_offset_y). Used for hand-assembler-facing designators

    """Power sub-sheet — J1 input + D1 surge clamp + Q1 reverse-polarity + R4/D3 Vgs clamp + R1 pulldown + F1 polyfuse + C1/C2 caps + U1 24V->5V buck.

    Power flow runs LEFT-TO-RIGHT and UPWARD on screen:

        J1 (input) ──┬── Q1.S → Q1.D → F1 → +24V (protected rail, exits up-right)
                     │     │            ↑

                     │     │                 anode → R4/R1 junction)
                     │     │
                     │     Q1.G → R4 (1k series) → (junction) → R1 (100k) → GND
                     │                              │
                     │                              D3.anode lands here
                     │
                     D1 (TVS surge clamp, shunts excess voltage to GND below)
                     │
                     └── J1.2 (GND), J1.3 (PE) — drop down to their own flags

    The TVS D1 sits BEFORE Q1 in the chain (tap point on the J1.1 → Q1.S
    wire). A surge that exceeds Q1's Vds_max would destroy Q1 before its
    reverse-polarity function could engage, so D1 must clamp upstream of
    Q1. SMBJ24A clamps at ~38.9V at 1A peak, leaving comfortable margin
    below Q1's absolute maximum (PMV65XP Vds_max = -50V).

    The Q1 gate-source clamp (R4 + D3) is mandatory because PMV65XP
    (like the previous DMP4015SK3) has Vgs_max = +/-20V, while the
    natural pull-down through R1 alone would set Vgs = -24V at the 24V
    supply, exceeding the absolute max. With D3 (18V Zener) shunting
    the gate-side junction to source whenever the gate tries to drop
    more than 18V below source, |Vgs| is clamped to <=18V. R4 (1k)
    provides series isolation in the gate path.

    Layout (page-absolute mm, KiCad +Y is down on screen):

        - J1 placed on the LEFT (mirror_y so pins face RIGHT into the circuit)
        - D1 mid-VIN (angle=90, body vertical), top pin on VIN wire, bottom
          pin drops to a local GND symbol. No new PWR_FLAG sentinel — the
          existing GND sentinel on J1.2 covers the global GND net.
        - Q1 placed to the right of D1, angle=0:
            Q1.D on top  → wire goes UP through F1 to the +24V power flag
            Q1.S on bottom-right (Y aligns with J1.1)
            Q1.G on left side → wire drops DOWN through R4 (series) →
                                R4/R1 junction → R1 (pulldown) → GND.
                                (Crosses J1.1 row at X=Q1_G_X without a
                                 junction — KiCad convention for the
                                 non-connected crossing.)
        - R4 (1k, series gate resistor) directly below Q1.G in the same
          column as R1. Body fits in clear Y band between VIN row (93.98)
          and the R4/R1 junction.
        - R1 (100k, gate pulldown) below R4; R1.bot → dedicated GND flag.
        - D3 (18V Zener, angle=270) placed LEFT of the R4/R1 column with
          its CATHODE wired UP to the VIN net (Q1.S side, via a T-tap on
          the existing vin-horiz wire) and its ANODE wired DOWN-and-RIGHT
          via an L-route to the R4/R1 junction. Clamp current at steady
          state flows S -> D3 (reverse breakdown at Vz=18V) -> junction
          -> R1 -> GND, drawing ~60 uA when active.
        - F1 above Q1.D, vertical Polyfuse
        - +24V flag, GND flag, Earth_Protective flag — each in its own column
          with ≥15 mm horizontal spacing between independent columns so the
          value-text labels of adjacent symbols cannot overlap.
        - PWR_FLAG sentinels are placed on each power net AT a junction
          on the main wire, with their Value-text offset SIDEWAYS (to the
          right of the symbol) so they never stack vertically with the
          power-flag's Value-text. This was the bug causing label overlap
          in the previous layout.
        - C1 (bulk electrolytic, 100uF 50V) sits in its OWN column to the
          right of F1, tapping the protected +24V rail at the F1.top pin
          and dropping to a local GND symbol. The horizontal +24V tap wire
          terminates at the F1.top pin, where the f1-to-junc24v wire
          continues upward to the +24V flag — a junction dot marks the
          three-way connection.
        - C2 (Y2 ceramic, 10nF Y2) closes the EMI loop between circuit
          GND and the PE conductor. Placed in clear space LEFT of the
          GND flag column with C2.top wired horizontally east to the
          Earth_Protective flag pin and C2.bot wired south-then-east to
          the existing GND horizontal at COL_GND. A junction dot at
          (COL_GND, GND_HORIZ_Y) marks the three-way GND tap.

    # by 20% and slowly destroying Q1. D3 (18V Zener) clamps |Vgs| to
    # <=18V by shunting current from Q1.S to the R4/R1 junction whenever
    # the junction voltage drops more than 18V below source. With the
    # clamp active, the junction sits at V_S - 18V = 6V; the gate sees the

    # 24V -> 5V buck converter block (U1 LM2596S-5.0 + L1 + D2 + C3/C3b/C4/C4b)
    # =========================================================================
    # First active block in the power section. Takes the protected +24V rail
    # (downstream of F1 / C1) and produces a regulated 5V output that powers
    # the LD2410 mmWave radar (~80 mA) and the WS2812 status LED (~60 mA
    # white-bright) — total ~140 mA, well below the LM2596's 3 A rating.
    #
    # Component selection rationale (see commit message and CLAUDE.md):
    #   * LM2596S-5.0  : 40 V Vin_max, fixed 5 V output, 3 A, 150 kHz, TO-263.
    #                    The 40 V rating is the binding constraint — it
    #                    matches D1 (SMBJ24A) which clamps surges at 38.9 V.
    #                    Lower-rated bucks (TPS62933 17V, MP2451 26V,
    #                    TPS54302 28V) would not survive a clamped surge.
    #                    Fixed-output variant eliminates the FB resistor
    #                    divider (one fewer place for a layout error).
    #   * L1 33 uH    : Standard inductor value from the LM2596 datasheet
    #                    typical-application table for 5 V output at 150 kHz.
    #                    Shielded ferrite-core part with >=2 A saturation and
    #                    low DCR (<100 mOhm) keeps EMI and conduction loss low.
    #                    The 2 A saturation rating is the binding requirement:
    #                    LM2596 has no internal soft-start, so cold-start of
    #                    C4 (220 uF output bulk) can push the peak inductor
    #                    current above 1 A in the first few switching cycles.
    #                    A 1 A-rated inductor would saturate and trigger an
    #                    LM2596 over-current latch, producing an ugly power-on
    #                    glitch. Candidate parts (verify JLCPCB stock at order

    #                    MANDATORY. SOD-123 or DO-214AC package, JLCPCB Basic.
    #   * C3 100uF/50V + C3b 100 nF : input bulk + HF bypass at U1.VIN.
    #                    50 V rating gives margin over the 24 V nominal AND

    #   * C4 220uF/10V + C4b 100 nF : output bulk + HF bypass at the +5V rail.
    #                    10 V rating gives 2x margin over 5 V; 220 uF is the

    # 5V -> 3.3V buck converter block (U2 TPS62933 + L2 + R2/R3 FB div + C5/C5b/C6/C6b/C7)
    # =========================================================================
    # Cascaded second buck stage. Takes the +5V rail produced by U1 (above)
    # and steps it down to a regulated 3.3V rail that powers the ESP32-C6
    # DevKitM-1-N4 (via its 3V3 pin, bypassing the module's onboard LDO so
    # we don't dissipate ~250 mW close to the SEN66 air-quality sensor),
    # plus the SEN66 itself, VEML7700 ambient light sensor, and NT3H2211
    # NFC tag.
    #
    # Component selection rationale (see commit message and CLAUDE.md):
    #   * TPS62933   : 3.8-30 V Vin range (17 V abs-max for the typical-use
    #                  recommendation, well above our 5 V), 3 A, 500 kHz
    #                  default, SYNCHRONOUS topology (no external Schottky
    #                  catch diode needed — high-side and low-side both
    #                  internal). SOT-583-8 package, JLCPCB Basic library.
    #                  ~95% efficiency at ~300 mA load — much better than
    #                  LM2596's ~80% (LM2596 has external Schottky losses
    #                  and runs at 150 kHz so the inductor ripple is much
    #                  larger). The 17 V Vin_max ceiling that ruled it out
    #                  upstream of D1 is irrelevant here because we cascade
    #                  from the regulated +5V rail.
    #   * L2 2.2uH  : Per TPS62933 datasheet typical-application table for
    #                  3.3 V output at 500 kHz. Shielded SMD ferrite-core
    #                  inductor with ≥2 A saturation and ~50 mOhm DCR.
    #                  4×4 mm or 3×3 mm package — much smaller than LM2596's
    #                  33 uH because the higher fsw drops the inductor
    #                  requirement by ~15×.
    #   * R2 44.2k 1% / R3 10k 1% (FB divider): TPS62933 FB pin reference
    #                  voltage = 0.6 V. Vout = Vfb × (1 + R2/R3) =
    #                  0.6 × (1 + 4.42) = 3.252 V — well within the
    #                  ESP32-C6's 3.0-3.6 V supply window and the typical
    #                  3.0-3.6 V supply requirements of SEN66, VEML7700,
    #                  NT3H2211. R3 = 10 kΩ gives a low-current divider
    #                  (~60 µA), and R2 = 44.2 kΩ is the nearest E96 value.
    #                  1% tolerance keeps the output voltage variation due
    #                  to divider tolerance below ±20 mV.
    #   * C5 10uF + C5b 100nF : input bulk + HF ceramic bypass at U2.VIN.
    #                  Per datasheet: ceramic X5R/X7R; 16 V rating gives
    #                  3× margin over the 5 V input.
    #   * C6 22uF + C6b 100nF : output bulk + HF ceramic bypass at the
    #                  +3.3V rail. Per datasheet; 10 V rating gives 3× margin
    #                  over 3.3 V.
    #   * C7 100nF (BST): bootstrap capacitor from BST pin to SW pin.
    #                  REQUIRED by TPS62933 for the high-side gate driver
    #                  bootstrap supply. Datasheet value.
    #   * C8 47nF (SS) : soft-start capacitor from SS pin to GND. SS tied
    #                  directly to GND DISABLES soft-start in TPS62933
    #                  (an earlier comment claiming a ~0.6 ms default was
    #                  incorrect — that figure came from a different TI
    #                  device family). With C8=47nF the soft-start time is
    #                  t_ss = C_ss * V_ref / I_ss = 47nF * 0.6V / 5uA ~=
    #                  5.6 ms, which falls within the 2-10 ms power-ramp
    #                  window specified by SEN66's application note for
    #                  reliable sensor initialization on cold boot.
    #
    # The RT pin (programmable switching frequency) is tied to GND — that
    # selects the default ~500 kHz internal oscillator. SS pin (soft-start)
    # uses C8 (47 nF) to ground to set t_ss ~= 5.6 ms (in the SEN66 power-
    # ramp window of 2-10 ms). EN pin is tied to VIN via a direct wire
    # (always-on operation — the TPS62933 enables when EN > 1.18 V, and
    # +5V provides plenty of headroom). The BST pin gets its bootstrap
    # cap C7 to the SW node.
    #
    # Layout (page-absolute mm, KiCad +Y is down on screen):
    #
    # The buck block sits BELOW the +24V protected-rail section so the
    # cascade flow reads top-to-bottom (24 V → 5 V → 3.3 V). U2 is placed
    # in the same X column as U1 (X=200.66) — vertically aligned, ~70 mm
    # below — emphasising the cascade visually. The +5V net enters U2.VIN
    # from above via a "+5V" global symbol placed at the top of the block;
    # the +3.3V net exits to the right through C6/C6b decoupling and a
    # PWR_FLAG sentinel into the +3.3V power flag at the far-right.

    #   R2 = 45 kΩ ideal → nearest E96 = 44.2 kΩ
    #   → Vout = 0.6 × (1 + 4.42) = 3.252 V  (within ESP32-C6's 3.0-3.6 V window)
    #
    # Layout: R2 (top, 44.2 kΩ) and R3 (bottom, 10 kΩ) vertically stacked,
    # forming a divider between +3.3V (R2.top) and GND (R3.bot). FB tap
    # point is the R2.bot/R3.top junction. The U2.FB pin (at X=208.28,
    # Y=152.40) routes to the FB tap via a short L-wire: drop DOWN from
    # FB pin to Y=156.21 (clear of U2 body bottom at Y=154.94), then
    # RIGHT to the FB tap column at X=226.06.
    #
    # R2 and R3 are placed with a 2.54 mm gap between R2.bot (Y=144.78)
    # and R3.top (Y=147.32) so the two resistor body rectangles don't
    # touch on screen — easier to read. The connecting wire between
    # R2.bot and R3.top serves as the FB tap point.
    #
    # Wait — re-examining: if R2.top is to land on the +3.3V bus row
    # (Y=137.16) directly, then R2_Y=140.97 (R2.top = 140.97 - 3.81 =
    # 137.16, R2.bot = 144.78). But that puts R2.bot at Y=144.78 = the
    # SW row! At X=226.06 the SW extension wire does NOT reach (SW wire
    # X∈[208.28, 218.44]), so no electrical conflict, but visually the
    # FB-tap row at Y=144.78 sits on the same horizontal as the SW node.
    #
    # Cleaner: keep R2.top one row above the bus and add a short vertical

    # (a few mm below bus), then r2top-to-bus wire from (226.06, 144.78)

#     Chip : ESP32-C6FH4 (ESP32-C6-MINI-1 SoM with 4 MB internal SiP flash).
#            GPIO 10 and GPIO 11 are NOT bonded out — they serve internal
#            flash communication. Available GPIOs: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,

#     Form factor : 48.26 × 25.4 mm. Two USB-C connectors (one through an
#                   onboard USB-to-UART bridge IC, one direct to native
#                   USB-Serial-JTAG on GPIO 12/13). Onboard power LED and
#                   addressable RGB NeoPixel (GPIO 8). Reset + Boot
#                   pushbuttons.
#     Headers : Two 15-pin headers, J1 (left) and J3 (right), 2.54 mm
#               pitch, mirroring Espressif's numbering. The symbol below
#               exposes all 30 header positions in faithful order so the

#
#     Pin layout (J1 left, J3 right) reproduced from the official user

    + R5/R6 I²C pull-ups + J2 recovery header.

                                          U3.1 (3V3 pin) at top of J1

      U3 anchored at (152.40, 110.49) with 30 pins (J1 left, J3 right;
      15 pins per header) modelled on the official Espressif user guide
      pin layout. R5 (SDA pull-up) drops south from the +3V3 bus and
      taps the SDA wire at U3.10 (GPIO 6). R6 (SCL pull-up) drops south
      and taps the SCL wire at U3.11 (GPIO 7); its vertical wire crosses
      the SDA horizontal wire mid-segment without a junction, so the two
      stay electrically distinct per KiCad's wire-crossing rule.

      J2 (SWD/UART recovery, DNP) sits to the right of U3, with TX/RX
      pins aligned to U3's J3.2 / J3.3 rows so the UART wires are short
      straight runs. BOOT and EN (RST) reach J2 via local labels (so we
      don't have to route a wire across the body of U3 from J1.2 (RST)
      to the right side).

    Pinout (v0.4 of CLAUDE.md / docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, post chip-pinout
    validation against the Espressif user guide). Pin numbers below are
    the symbol's own (1..30) numbers, mapping to the DevKitM-1 J1/J3
    header positions as recorded in ESP32C6_DEVKITM1_PINS:
      U3.1  (J1.1)  3V3      → +3V3 bus
      U3.2  (J1.2)  RST      → local label "RST" (joins to J2.5 EN)
      U3.3  (J1.3)  GPIO2    → LD2410_OUT (presence interrupt)
      U3.4  (J1.4)  GPIO3    → NFC_FD (NT3H2211 field detect)
      U3.5..9       GPIO4/5/0/1/8  no-connect (strap pins / unused / RGB LED)
      U3.10 (J1.10) GPIO6    → I2C_SDA
      U3.11 (J1.11) GPIO7    → I2C_SCL
      U3.12 (J1.12) GPIO14   no-connect
      U3.13 (J1.13) GND      → GND
      U3.14 (J1.14) 5V       no-connect
      U3.15 (J1.15) GND      → GND
      U3.16 (J3.1)  GND      → GND
      U3.17 (J3.2)  GPIO16   → UART_TX (256000 baud → LD2410 RX)
      U3.18 (J3.3)  GPIO17   → UART_RX (256000 baud ← LD2410 TX)
      U3.19..25     GPIO23/22/21/20/19/18/15  no-connect
      U3.26 (J3.11) GPIO9    → local label "BOOT" (joins to J2.6 BOOT)
      U3.27 (J3.12) GND      → GND
      U3.28..29     GPIO13/12 no-connect (USB D+/D-, onboard USB only)
      U3.30 (J3.15) GND      → GND

    Inter-sheet nets exported via hierarchical_label (matching sheet ports
    are added to oas.kicad_sch's MCU sheet block):
      I2C_SDA, I2C_SCL    → sensors sub-sheet
      UART_TX, UART_RX    → sensors sub-sheet (LD2410)
      LD2410_OUT          → sensors sub-sheet
      NFC_FD              → sensors sub-sheet

    +3V3 and GND are NOT exported as hierarchical labels: the power
    section already declared them via global power symbols, which is
    KiCad's canonical mechanism for spanning power nets across hierarchy.
    Adding hier labels for them would produce "multiple net names on the
    same net" ERC noise without any electrical benefit.

    J2 (SWD/UART Recovery, DNP) pinout — same as v0.3:
      J2.1 (top)    +3V3
      J2.2          GND
      J2.3          UART_TX
      J2.4          UART_RX
      J2.5          RST           (matches RST local label near U3.2)

    """Sensors sub-sheet — chunk #5a: SEN66 connection (J3 + C10).

    Populates the SEN66 portion only. Other sensors (VEML7700 ambient
    light, LD2410 presence radar, NT3H2211 NFC dynamic tag) are added in
    later chunks #5b..#5d.

    SEN66 pinout (Sensirion SEN6x datasheet v0.92 Dec 2025, Table 16
    on p. 15) — applies to the entire SEN6x family (SEN62, SEN63C,
    SEN65, SEN66, SEN68, SEN69C):

      Pin 1: VDD  — Supply voltage (3.15-3.6 V)
      Pin 2: GND  — Ground
      Pin 3: SDA  — Serial data input/output (I²C, open-drain)
      Pin 4: SCL  — Serial clock input         (I²C, open-drain)
      Pin 5: GND  — Ground or NC  (internally tied to pin 2)
      Pin 6: VDD  — Supply voltage or NC (internally tied to pin 1)

    The SEN6x is I²C-only — there is no SEL/UART-mode select pin on
    this family. (Earlier Sensirion modules had a SEL pin to choose
    between I²C and UART; SEN6x dropped UART entirely.) Pins 5 and 6
    duplicate pins 2 and 1 respectively, internally bonded together
    for current-carrying and contact redundancy.

    Wiring choice: tie pin 5 → GND and pin 6 → VDD (matching the
    internal pairing). This adds zero electrical risk (the pins are
    already tied internally) and gives better connector contact
    resilience than leaving pins 5/6 as no-connect on the JST-GH
    cable. A pin chafe or contact failure on either the VDD or GND
    line would otherwise interrupt the sensor; with both pins active,
    the second pin keeps the sensor running.

    Connector: SEN66 module side uses ACES 51468-0064N-001 (or
    51452-006H0H0-001), compatible with JST GHR-06V-S. PCB-side
    socket on OAS: JST SM06B-GHS-TB (1.25 mm pitch, horizontal entry,
    SMD), part of the JST GH series. Mating cable: any 6-pin JST GH
    cable, ~50 mm length recommended (datasheet §3 says max 10 cm to
    keep I²C crosstalk low — 50 mm is comfortable).

    Local decoupling: C10 (100 nF 0402 X7R) sits between VDD and GND
    of the SEN66 plug. SEN66 has internal regulation, but a local
    100 nF damps any cable transient ringing on the +3V3 rail at the
    JST-GH socket — cheap insurance.

    Inter-sheet nets imported via hierarchical_label (matching sheet
    pins are declared on the root sheet's Sensors block):
      I2C_SDA   (bidirectional, from MCU sub-sheet's GPIO 6)
      I2C_SCL   (input,         from MCU sub-sheet's GPIO 7)

    +3V3 and GND join via global power symbols, the same KiCad
    convention used in the MCU and power sub-sheets.
